GoCryptFS Security
==================

Master Key Storage
------------------

The master key is used to perform content and file name encryption.
It is stored in `gocryptfs.conf`, encrypted with AES-256-GCM using the
Key Encryption Key (KEK).

The KEK is generated from the user password using `scrypt`.

File Contents
-------------

All file contents are encrypted using AES-256-GCM.

Files are segmented into 4KB blocks. Each block gets a fresh random
96 bit IV each time it is modified. A 128-bit authentication tag (GHASH)
protects each block from modifications.

Each file has a header containing a random 128-bit file ID. The
file ID and the block number are mixed into the GHASH as
additional authenticated data. The prevents blocks from being copied
between or within files.

To support sparse files, all-zero blocks are accepted and passed through
unchanged.

File Names
----------

Every directory gets a 128-bit directory IV that is stored in each
directory as `gocryptfs.diriv`.

File names are encrypted using AES-256-CBC with the directory IV.
